<p class="explanation">
<p> Time is an abstract concept, and, as such, requires us to make use of language patterns like metaphors in order to communicate about it.</p>

<p> Lera Borodistky, a linguistics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has studied a number of these metaphors in order to better understand how people percieve of time. She has found that, although time does not actually exist in space, all human languages seem to organize time as if it exists as motion along some spatial continuum; front to back, top to bottom, left to right, east to west, etc.</p>

<p> In one of her published studies, she writes the following: </p>

<p><em>Suppose you are told that next Wednesday's meeting has been moved forward 2 days. What day is the meeting, now that it has been rescheduled? The answer to this question depends on how you choose to think about time. If, on the one hand, you think of yourself as moving forward through time (the ego-moving perspective), then moving a meeting "forward" is moving it further in your direction of motion -- that is, from Wednesday to Friday. If, on the other hand, you think of time as coming toward you (the time-moving perspective), then moving a meeting "forward" is moving it closer to you -- that is, from Wednesday to Monday (Boroditsky, 2000; McGlone & Harding, 1998; McTaggart, 1908).</p>

<p> Most people have very strong intuitions about which answer to this question is correct. As we discuss here, however, the question is indeed ambiguous, and individuals' intuitions about the answer can change dramatically depending on contect (though their certainty of their answers generally remains untouched). In a neutral context, people are as likely to think of themselves as moving through time as they are to think of time as coming toward them, and so are as likely to say that the meeting has been moved to Friday (the ego-moving answer) as they are to say that it has been moved to Monday(the time-moving answer) (Boroditsky, 2000; McGlone & Harding, 1998).</em></p>

<p> To think in time moving terms means that you think of time as flowing past you, like a river would. To think in ego moving terms means that you think of yourself as moving through time, like you would move through space. There is no "correct" answer to our question, it was asked in order for us to determine whether the majority of our responders think one way, or whether the split was mostly even.</p>

<p> Interestingly, even though all human languages use spatial language to talk about time, the way that we do so is strikingly different. For instance, Chinese languages tend to time as a straight up and down line, with the past being above us, and the future being below.</p>

<p>The Greek languages, on the other hand, see things slightly different than us, with the future being <em>behind<em> behind us and the past in front of us. In order to understand why this is so, think of the fact that while the future, wherever you may concieve of it spatially, is not something that is yet known, and therefore not something that can be seen. Whereas the past, wherever you may conceive of it spatially, is something that is known and can therefore be seen.
